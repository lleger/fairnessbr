  <div class="col-md-10">
    <p>Thank you members of the council, President Pro Tem. My name is Gene Mills. I&rsquo;m the President of Louisiana Family Forum. First of all I want to commend you for your civil decorum that we&rsquo;ve exercised here today. I know this is not easy. You have passion on both sides of the line and I appreciate the opportunity to present our ideas. Forgive me though if I examine the policy that&rsquo;s before you today and I have a healthy distrust for this pledge. </p>
    <p>If you like your religious freedom, you can keep your religious freedom, because we&rsquo;ve watched under God in the pledge, in Jesus name, in God we trust, prayer in the public schools, public affirmations of the Judeo-Christian faith, come under deep scrutiny all over the country and in courts and before councils and before our even legislator here in the State of Louisiana. And before I go any further, I&rsquo;d like to dispel two myths that were communicated here today, with great respect to my friends on both sides of the aisle. </p>
    <p>And I do have friends and family on both sides of the aisle. But I have firm convictions that do not need, and I would say to the council are not required of you to tiptoe around, but rather to express and stand for your deeply held convictions. Those two misunderstandings are this. If for some reason you oppose an idea or a lifestyle that a person is living, somehow you are afraid of that person or the other extreme, you hate that person. Those are bogus premises that I want to dismiss outright because that is not the position that we&rsquo;re here to communicate today [00:02:00]. </p>
    <p>Neither is the position that I hold and I am responsible for working with pastors all over the State and the city to generate both a press release that gently admonished you that this was not a good policy and on its merit and encourage pastors to express their conviction about that too. The second myth is that if you love somebody, you accept anything and everything absolutely that they embrace, do or communicate. Friends, that is bogus and I would ask you not to fall prey to either of those two extremes. </p>
    <p>It was Plato that said a child who&rsquo;s afraid of the darkness we can understand. What&rsquo;s intolerable are adults who are afraid of the light. And my great fear is that if we remove something as fundamental as the essential liberty called religious liberty that&rsquo;s founded in our constitution and embodied in the First Amendment by saying certain things are permissible to communicate and others are absolutely impermissible, we create a very dangerous and, I might add, litigious community. &ldquo;Be Fair, Baton Rouge&rdquo; in my opinion is incorrectly named. It is both unfair and unconstitutional because we ban speech. </p>
    <p>We ban ideas and we&rsquo;ll ban &hellip; I might add areas of jurisdiction that this council does not possess constitutionally. When you raised your hand and swore to uphold the Constitution, that was your limit of authority. You will be held by what that Constitution allows you do. It&rsquo;s unfair because it bans certain communication and expression, even employers from disciplining activist employees. It demands discrimination against some people of faith who walk outside of the zone of protection that your exclusion creates with what is called the religious exemption. I&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment. </p>
    <p>And in my opinion it violates articles six section nine of the Louisiana Constitution, which prohibits municipalities [00:04:00] from creating new causes of action that will be settled in the District Court that are not reflected in State Law. By the way this matter is not reflected in State Law, it was shot down repeatedly because it was seen as onerous, litigious and unnecessary. I agree with that. It&rsquo;s my opinion that an individual&rsquo;s conscious &hellip; forgive me. I know you&rsquo;ve got a clock keeper, but I saw what he did to the first half of this too. An individual&rsquo;s conscience, regardless of which side of this issue, ought to dictate private civil decisions, not the heavy hand of municipal government. </p>
    <p>And you&rsquo;re interjecting the police power of this body into those decisions and friends I don&rsquo;t think you have the authority to do so, not constitutionally. It is not the Council&rsquo;s business to create winners and losers. It&rsquo;s to make certain that the residents of this community are treated equitably, which I might add we all believe needs to be done. I might also add that this new subject matter creates some controversy and questions like the young lady who came here and told you her name was Champagne Star and the difficulty that&rsquo;s created with how do we resolve those business decisions, employment decisions, restroom decisions is not adequately answered in that policy that&rsquo;s before you. Be Realistic, Baton Rouge. </p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t need to insert sexual politics into private schools like Cyprus Heights Academy, which doesn&rsquo;t belong to a local religious order. It&rsquo;s a standalone operation that has more than ten employees and would be subject to the principles of your policy in its hiring and in its administration. It would subject nonprofit ministries like the crisis pregnancy centers and unwed mothers homes to hiring and other accommodation decisions that I&rsquo;m sure were not the intention of the author of this measure. </p>
    <p>It would create unnecessary conflict at places like the battered women&rsquo;s shelter who would have to decide if an individual who identifies their gender differently than their biological gender and is [00:06:00] subject of spousal abuse, will they then have to accept that individual into women&rsquo;s shelter? So called religious exemptions in this policy protect religious buildings, not religious people. If you walk outside of that building, you&rsquo;re subject to a litigation and/or the prohibition of your First Amendment rights. I think it creates a bull&rsquo;s eye on Baton Rouge. I have prepared a background that will tell you what that policy does. </p>
    <p>My colleague, who is coming shortly after, will explain that policy. I would encourage you to vote this down and not because I disrespect or I have any enemies, that I know of, on this side of the issue. We can chuckle, but I want you to know I don&rsquo;t have any known enemies, and today if we can make it right I would work to do that because just like the young physician who stood there and said without discrimination, as a ministry of the gospel I&rsquo;m told to tell the truth. I&rsquo;m here to testify the truth before you today; this is not a good idea. </p>
    <p>And this is not going mandate respect, the compulsory effort to dictate that you&rsquo;ve got to respect and appreciate another person&rsquo;s lifestyle. That you may hold a deeply held religious belief on them, it&rsquo;s not the policy of a council. That is something that&rsquo;s got to be generated like charity out of the overflow of the human heart and Christ did that to me and I believe that can make the difference, both with regard to relationships, communication, cooperation and how we resolve conflict. Thank you and God bless you. </p>
